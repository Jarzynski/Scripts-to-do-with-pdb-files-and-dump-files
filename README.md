# Scripts-to-do-with-pdb-files-and-dump-files
These are some scripts to create the water environment around an ice(generated by genice2(https://pypi.org/project/GenIce2/). And others used ovito python API to seek for the max ice number in system.
get-max-cluster.py used ovito python API to deal with the lammpstraj file and get the size evolution of ice(1h and 1c structure only)

test-to-translate/write-TIP4P-water.py create completely parallel water molecule with .pdb format(TIP4P structure), the equilibrium of TIP4P in MD is vary fast, so this kind of system won't affect results so much.
